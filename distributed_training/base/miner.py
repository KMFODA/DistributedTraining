        Initiates and manages the main loop for the miner on the Bittensor network. The main loop handles graceful shutdown on keyboard interrupts and logs unforeseen errors.

        This function performs the following primary tasks:
        1. Check for registration on the Bittensor network.
        2. Starts the miner's axon, making it active on the network.
        3. Periodically resynchronizes with the chain; updating the metagraph with the latest network state and setting weights.

        The miner continues its operations until `should_exit` is set to True or an external interruption occurs.
        During each epoch of its operation, the miner waits for new blocks on the Bittensor network, updates its
        knowledge of the network (metagraph), and sets its weights. This process ensures the miner remains active
        and up-to-date with the network's latest state.

        Note:
            - The function leverages the global configurations set during the initialization of the miner.
            - The miner's axon serves as its interface to the Bittensor network, handling incoming and outgoing requests.

        Raises:
            KeyboardInterrupt: If the miner is stopped by a manual interruption.
